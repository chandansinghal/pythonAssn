#Write a Python program to print a specified list after removing the 0th, 4th and 5th elements.
#Sample List : ['Red', 'Green', 'White', 'Black', 'Pink', 'Yellow']
#Expected Output : ['Green', 'White', 'Black']


print('*********Please input atleast 6 elements for list; seperated by space*******')
promptInput=raw_input()
gvnList=promptInput.split()

del gvnList[0]
del gvnList[3] # after previous deletes index will shift left
del gvnList[3] # after previous deletes index will shift left

# we can also do by identifying the elements at the given positions and use remove function,
# but in case of duplicate values before given index, wrong value will be removed.

print("after deleting 0th, 4th and 5th elements from the given list")
